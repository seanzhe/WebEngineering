	<h1>COMP 120: Web Programming and Engineering</h1>
	<h2>Tufts University Department of Computer Science, Summer Session A ONLINE</h2>

	<h2>Course Description</h2>
	<p>Web applications as complex systems that deliver a plethora of functionality to a large number of users, and
		exhibit unique behaviors and demands in terms of performance, scalability, usability, and security. How the web

	<h2 id="labs">Labs and Workload: All The Labs with Expected Length and Difficulty</h2>
	<p>Generally speaking, workload is hard to say because the skill-set of the students varies: from those who have
		just completed Introduction to Computer Science and/or Data Structures to those who already have a Computer
		Science degree. In terms of number of hours you should expect to spend per week, my rough estimate and
		expectation is anywhere from 3 to 10 hours of work a week.</p>

	<p>All labs for a given week are due on the following week on a Wednesday at 11:59 PM PDT (so yes, a week-and-a-half
		to do all labs for a week). The new week will be made available on Monday morning at 10 AM PDT. Late labs are
		not accepted.</p>
	<ul>

	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	<h3>Q: Is there a textbook for this course?</h3>
	<p>A: No</p>
	<h3>Q: Are there teaching assistants (TAs) for this course?</h3>
	<p>A: No</p>
	<h3>Q: This course looks a lot like COMP 20: Web Programming! What gives?</h3>
	<p>That is correct! This course is now COMP 20: Web Programming with add-ons. Here are the reasons behind the
		changes:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Too many graduate students have wanted to take COMP 20: Web Programming in the past, and it makes no
			business sense to not allow graduate students to take the course --hence it has to be a 100 level number
		</li>
		<li>COMP 120 will be part of the Tufts Computer Science Online Master's Program</li>
		<li>I have been wanting to change up COMP 120 anyway</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Q: What are the add-ons in this course, the differences between COMP 120 and COMP 20?</h3>
	<p>The biggest change is the move from using MongoDB (a "NoSQL" database) to a SQL database, namely PostgreSQL. The
		reason for this change: it has been very disheartening to see many students graduating without knowing how to
		use a SQL-based database system. SQL-based database systems are still widely used in the world, and are also
		important in the data sciences. Static Content Performance Optimization is also added as a topic.</p>
	<h3>Q: If I have taken COMP 20: Web Programming in the past, can I take this class?</h3>
	<p>A: No</p>
	<h3>Q: Is the old COMP 120 website and content still available?</h3>
	<p>Sure, <a href="spring2017">here you go (from spring 2017 semester)</a>.</p>
	<h3>Q: Why is there a course website and a course Canvas?</h3>
	<p>Canvas is used for (1) quizzes, (2) distributing grades and feedback. This website is used (1) to serve a
		reference for alumni of this, (2) to serve as a reference for employers who are looking to hire students from
		this course, and (3) for redundancy if Canvas goes down.</p>

	<h2 id="expectations">Expectations and Structure of This Online Course</h2>
	<p>This course will be a fun one for sure. A few notes on the expectations and structure of this course:</p>

	<h3>1. What this course will NOT have and what I will NOT do:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Have set office hours.</li>
		<li>Have synchronous lectures and long video recordings of lectures.</li>
		<li>Require students to meet online during specific times.</li>
		<li>Require students to work in teams, a semester group project.</li>
		<li>Require students to physical meet at the Tufts Medford Campus.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There are many good reasons why I will not do any of the above items:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It's summertime. Many of you have commitments and plans already scheduled.</li>
		<li>A number of you are working (full-time or internship). That's more important as people need to live, eat.
		</li>
		<li>Some students are taking this course abroad. Thus, there are time zone differences.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Adding constraints and extra burden to your lives especially during the summer will not fit well with anyone.
		Extra constraints and burden also defeat the purpose of an online course. Thus, you will probably not see me at
		all this summer.</p>

	<h3>2. You are on your own pace.</h3>
	<p>You can choose to:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Pace yourself during the week</li>
		<li>Do everything during the weekend</li>
		<li>Do everything during the last minute</li>
		<li>Don't do any of the work</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Your choice, but the latter three choices are not wise.</p>

	<h3>3. You are responsible for your own learning.</h3>
	<p>A very important point: if you want everything gone over in lecture or in notes, then this is not the course for
		you. More importantly, that's not how things work in real life.</p>

	<h3>4. You will learn by doing.</h3>
	<p>Each week, there will be at most three labs to hone your skills and to aim at the
		crux of the matter for the week. Here's an analogy: you don't learn how to cook simply by just reading cookbooks
		and watching YouTube videos. You learn by making, using your hands, and making mistakes.</p>

	<h3>5. You will learn by asking questions.</h3>
	<p>It is your responsibility to ask questions early and to ask for help...</p>

	<h3>6. ...and I expect discussions online to be very active and civil.</h3>
	<p>Share thoughts and respond to other people's questions. I will be online constantly, thus the idea of set office
		hours almost becomes moot point. It is no secret that I respond very quickly unless I need to be away.</p>
