<h1>COMP 120: Web Programming and Engineering</h1>
<h2>Lab: Your Portfolio</h2>

<p class="note">This assignment is worth 9 points.  You must work on this assignment individually.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>While this is a rather simple lab, it serves two important purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use HTML5 and CSS.</li>
<li>Help you put together a personal portfolio: whether you are looking for an opportunity (internship or full-time), to continue with graduate school, or to brand yourself (which everyone should do anyway).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Using only HTML5 and CSS, you are to create three (3) personal web pages:</p>

<p><code>resume.html</code> - Your resume. This can be real or fictitious (e.g., for FERPA reasons).  It shall include the following sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>Full name or handle (if you are not comfortable with providing your identity).  <span class="note">IMPORTANT: For privacy reasons, please do not list your addresses or telephone numbers.</span></li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Relevant Coursework</li>
<li>Professional Experience.  For each job, list accomplishments.  Use the past-tense if you no longer work at the job; in the present-tense if you are currently employed at the job.  Use bullets-points, an unordered list.</li>
<li>Skills (e.g., programming languages)</li>
<li>Activities that are related to your field of study or work</li>
</ol>

<p><code>bio.html</code> - A short biography of yourself.  This can be real or fictitious (e.g., for FERPA reasons).</p>

<p><code>index.html</code> - Your personal home page.  This page is accessed by <code>http://<span class="stress">YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME</span>.github.io</code> (notice the <code>index.html</code> is not necessary at the end of the URL.  It is inferred to be <code>index.html</code>).  This page shall contain:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your name --real or fictitious (e.g., for FERPA reasons)</li>
<li>A photo of you --real or fictitious (e.g., for FERPA reasons)</li>
<li>A link to your resume</li>
<li>A link to your short biography</li>
</ol>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<p>You must adhere to the following guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li>All HTML pages must pass the official HTML5 specifications via <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">http://validator.w3.org/</a></li>
<li>You must use at least one (1) CSS file. The CSS file, or one of the CSS files, must have at least 5 rules</li>
<li>All CSS files must pass the official CSS validation via <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank">http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/</a></li>
<li>You <span class="stress">cannot</span> use frames.</li>
<li>You <span class="stress">cannot</span> use any styling element for any purpose (e.g., <code>&lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, &lt;font&gt;, &lt;center&gt;</code>).  All styling must be defined in CSS.</li>
<li>You <span class="stress">cannot</span> use any styling attribute in elements (e.g., <code>&lt;h3 align="center"&gt;</code>).</li>
<li>You <span class="stress">cannot</span> use absolute URLs for images.</li>
<li>You <span class="stress">cannot</span> use front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap.</li>
<li>You <span class="stress">cannot</span> use other people's CSS files.</li>
<li>You <span class="stress">cannot</span> use JavaScript (or jQuery for that matter; considering we have not covered JavaScript yet!).</li>
<li>All file names must be in lowercase and only <code>[a-z0-9_.]</code> characters can be used for file names (universal standard).  That is, do not use whitespace in file names!</li>
<li>All content must be stored in your special repo <code><span class="stress">YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME</span>.github.io</code>, master branch, of your GitHub account.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Please do the <a href="lab-git.html">Git lab</a> first.</p>
<p>You must create a special repo under your GitHub account.  Please read <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages" target="_blank">https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages</a>, the "User &amp; Organization Pages" section.  That is, you must create a Git repo under your account named <code><span class="stress">YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME</span>.github.io</code>.</p>

<h2>Viewing Your Website</h2>
<p>Go to <code>https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io</code></p>
<p>If your website does not show up, don't panic, one of three scenarios:</p>
<ol>
	<li>You need to verify your e-mail address on GitHub.</li>
	<li>It may take up to 10 minutes.</li> 
	<li>Check your email for a not-so-good email from GitHub.  It may not have been deployed successfully because of some error (e.g., a <code>node_modules</code> folder in your repo --unlikely for this lab).</li>
</ol>

<h2>The <code>README</code> File</h2>
<p>Each lab shall include a <code>README</code> file that describes the work. This description must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.</li>
<li>Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the lab.</li>
<li>Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the lab.</li>
<li>Be written in either text format (<code>README.txt</code>) or in Markdown (<code>README.md</code>).  Markdown is preferred.  No other formats will be accepted.  Please use all capital letters for <code>README</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<li><strong>(1 point)</strong> Used Git constantly: committing with meaningful messages and pushing to GitHub.</li>
